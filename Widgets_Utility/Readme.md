#Databricks widgets utility
Databricks widgets are a powerful feature within Databricks notebooks that help in creating interactive and parameterized notebooks.
Widgets allow users to create user input forms directly in notebooks, which can be used to pass parameters to notebooks and dynamically adjust the notebook's behavior based on user inputs.

#Types of Widgets

Dropdown Widget: Provides a list of options for users to select from.
Combobox Widget: Similar to a dropdown, but allows users to either select from the list or enter their own value.
